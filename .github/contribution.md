## 🛠️ Core Components

- **Domain Layer** (`omega_domain`) - Core business logic and interfaces
- **Tool Layer** (`omega_tool`) - Development tools implementation
- **Server Layer** (`omega_services`) - API endpoints and persistence
- **Main Application** (`omega_main`) - CLI and application coordination

## 🔧 Configuration

The application requires several environment variables for proper operation:

```bash
# Required environment variables
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:path/to/database.db"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

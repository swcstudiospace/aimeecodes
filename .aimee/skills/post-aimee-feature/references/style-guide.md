# Twitter Post Style Guide - AimeeCodes Features

## Tone

- Direct and technical, written by a developer, for developers.
- Confident but not hype-y. Let the feature speak for itself.
- Conversational, not corporate.

## Vocabulary

**Prefer:**
- "AimeeCodes", "agent", "task", "context", "codebase", "workflow"
- Short, active-voice sentences.
- Concrete nouns over abstract ones ("file watcher" not "intelligent monitoring capability").

**Avoid:**
- "Aimee" alone as the product name. Always use "AimeeCodes".
- Em dashes (--) anywhere in the post. Use commas, colons, or periods instead.
- "excited to announce", "thrilled", "proud to share"
- "game changer", "revolutionary", "supercharge", "unlock", "seamlessly"
- Passive voice ("it can be used to...")
- Jargon that non-Rust developers won't know (unless the feature is Rust-specific)

## Example Posts

**Custom agents:**
> AimeeCodes lets you define custom agents for specific tasks: code review, refactoring, docs. Each agent gets its own system prompt and tool set. Less context noise, better results.
>
> #AimeeCodes #Agents #DevTools

**Shell integration:**
> AimeeCodes's shell plugin tracks your terminal history and feeds relevant context to the agent. No more copy-pasting commands to explain what went wrong.
>
> #AimeeCodes #CLI #DevTools

**Multi-file edits:**
> AimeeCodes can plan and apply changes across multiple files in a single task. Rename a type, update all call sites, fix the tests, done in one pass.
>
> #AimeeCodes #AICode #DevTools

**Context compaction:**
> Long tasks no longer blow up the context window. AimeeCodes automatically compacts older turns while keeping the essential state. Tasks that used to fail mid-way now run to completion.
>
> #AimeeCodes #ContextWindow #AICode
